ESD MEVN Project

Employablilty Skill Development is taught in TCET to introduce us to the current market trends to improve our employablilty skills.

During these sessions, we made an app using MongoDB, ExpressJS, VueJS and Node.js, which are usually used by current companies for their applications.

The frontend of the project is pushed here and the backend is hosted via Heroku app.
